# Substratum Documentation

In this repo, there will information regarding Substratum, OMS7, and our theme
template. This is meant to be a jumping off point for ROMs and themers wanting
to get on board with our platform. If there is something you feel needs to be
added, please contact Nathan Chancellor via email (natechancellor@gmail.com),
Hangouts (the same as email), or Telegram (@nathanchance).
